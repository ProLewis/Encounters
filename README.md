# Encounters

A clone of DnDBeyond's Encounter Builder: https://www.dndbeyond.com/encounter-builder

The majority of this project was built in one week for my capstone MERN project.

This project was built in React, and utilizes Axios and Express.

MongoDB provided a simple non-relational database management system.

The frontend was styled using ReactStrap and some custom CSS.
